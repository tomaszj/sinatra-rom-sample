sinatra-rom-sample
==================

Two trivial examples on how Sinatra can work with Ruby Object Mapper (version 0.7.0 currently):

* Example for in-memory graph (`in_memory` folder)
* Example for SQLite in-memory DB (`sqlite` folder)

## How to run each sample

First, install needed gems by:

    $ bundle install

Then, simply run the Sinatra app:

    $ ruby app.rb

Then you can open localhost:4567 and go to "/", "/uber-items" and "/uber-items/1" URLs to see the functionality.
