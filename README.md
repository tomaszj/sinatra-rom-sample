==================

Trivial example on how Sinatra may work with Ruby Object Mapper.

## How to run

First, install needed gems by
    
    $ bundle install

Then, simply run the Sinatra app:

    $ ruby app.rb

Then you can open localhost:4567 and go to "/", "/uber-items" and "/uber-items/1" URLs to see the functionality.
